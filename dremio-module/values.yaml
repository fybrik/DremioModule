# Annotations, labels, node selectors, and tolerations

# annotations: Annotations are applied to the StatefulSets that are deployed.
# podAnnotations: Pod annotations are applied to the pods that are deployed.
# labels: Labels operate much like annotations.
# podLabels: Labels that are applied to the pods that are deployed.
# nodeSelector: Target pods to nodes based on labels set on the nodes. For more
#   information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector
# tolerations: Tolerations allow the negation of taints that have been applied to some set of nodes
#   in the Kubernetes cluster so that pods can be scheduled on those tainted nodes.
